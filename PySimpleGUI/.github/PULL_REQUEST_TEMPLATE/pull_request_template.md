## Pull Request Instructions

**Pull requests are not currently accepted for for core code which are these files:**

* PySimpleGUI.py
* PySimpleGUIQt.py
* PySimpleGUIWx.py
* PySimpleGUIWeb.py

The bandwidth required to review and merge these changes simply isn't there.  Because PySimpleGUI core files are a single file,
ALL submitted pull requests required a manual merge of the code.

If you have code that you believe will fix a problem in the core code, post it in the Issue that discusses the problem.  
This has worked well in the past as it enables the community to see the proposed changes.

Pull Requests for the Demo Files are being accepted and are welcomed.
